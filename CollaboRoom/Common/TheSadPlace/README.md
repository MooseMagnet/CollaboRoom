# The Sad Place

In here is a bunch of stuff I wish I didn't have to make.

They'll be workarounds for one or more of:
- SwiftUI bugs
- SwiftUI deficiencies
- Platform-specific idiosyncrasies that don't make a great deal of sense
- My own ignorance / lack of skill to come up with a better way

I imagine mostly the latter.
